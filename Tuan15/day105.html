<p>OK, are you all <mark>settled</mark>? Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University. I'm here to explain what we can offer you.</p>

<p>Now, as a new student at the university, you will probably need some sort of <u title="">guidance</u> to help you to use the library <u title="">effectively</u> to study and research. Some of you have asked about a guided tour but we <mark>find</mark> this rather <mark>muddles</mark> people. So, in this first week, we run a series of talks which focus on different <mark>aspects</mark> of the library and its resources. You'll also find that to get the most out of the library you really do need to be <u title="">computer literate</u> and so all this <u title="">term</u> we run small classes which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information.</p>

<p>OK, now let me give you an <mark>outline</mark> of what's <u title="">available</u> to you. You'll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool. Many students do most of their research on the internet and the library computers are <u title="">permanently</u> online. <dfn data-inf="Having p2 đứng đầu câu: rút gọn câu có&#13;&#10;2 mệnh đề và có cùng chủ từ&#13;&#10;(= After you had found what you need, you'll...)&#13;&#10;VD: Having finished their supper (bữa tối), the&#13;&#10;boys went out to play.&#13;&#10;(After the boys had finished their supper…)">Having found what you need, you'll find</dfn> you can readily save texts on your personal computer space to print off when you need. You might think that it is the fastest way to get information but the links can be slow. Clearly you can find lots on there but much of it is <mark>useless</mark> information as it is from highly <mark>debatable</mark> sources - so be <u title="">critical</u>. You'll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMS onto the computers from <u title="">specialist</u> <u title="">reference</u> sources such as the MLA. It means we can expand what we offer you at very little extra cost and saves us having to <mark>invest</mark> in more and more books. The CD-ROMS contain exactly the same information as the reference books as the two are updated together.</p>

<p>Now most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work and you'll find you can also access these online and we <u title="">encourage</u> you to do so.</p>

<p>Clearly some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves but I'm afraid the <u title="">intention</u> is to <mark>phase these out</mark> <mark>eventually</mark>. However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text rather than photocopying the journal pages. So you must <u title="">get used to</u> working online. Naturally we do still have the full range of classic reference book, additional to the CD-ROMS, for you to use and there are several copies of each one. This is because some of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library. There is a <mark>restricted</mark> <mark>loan time</mark> on these so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long. Although there is a Section Manager for each part of the library, they are very busy and so, if you do get <mark>stuck</mark> <u title="">looking for</u> things, you should ask the <mark>relevant</mark> Cataloguing Assistant. As your Training <u title="">Supervisor</u>, I just <u title="">oversee</u> your <mark>induction</mark> and will not be around after this <mark>initial</mark> week.</p>

<p>Some of you may be interested to know that the library is offering <u title="">specialised training sessions</u> on writing a <mark>dissertation</mark>. <u title="">Obviously</u> this is not relevant to those of you who are <u title="">undergraduates</u>; it is just for <u title="">postgraduates</u>. Your <u title="">department</u> will <u title="">discuss</u> the planning stage of the dissertation - i.e, what you're going to do - with you and we will focus on the structure of it. However, the training will also include some time on the computers. I realise most of you know how to <u title="">organise</u> files but we can show you the different ways to run data programmes. Your <mark>tutors</mark> will tell you <mark>at the outset</mark> how to <mark>set out</mark> the chapters they <u title="">require</u> but you will need to ask them how they would like to organise the <mark>bibliography</mark> because it <u title="">varies</u> <i><b>depending on</b></i> your subject area. When you've got something together the trainer here will <u title="">look through</u> the <mark>draft</mark> version for you to see if it's OK. And, one final point, for those of you who have <u title="">registered</u> from <mark>abroad</mark>, we can offer <mark>individual</mark> sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them. If you require language lessons then they are available from the International Center next to the Law Department.</p>
